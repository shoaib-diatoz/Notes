		//Properties of string 
//		1. string is immutable
//      2. all string occupy same space in heap storage that is name as string pool
//		3. string is a class which belong to java.lang package
//      4. String is a object types/ or an object in java
		
		
		// Object oriented programming language.
//		What is oops ?
//		Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects,
//		rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
//		There are 4 concept of oops which is to be support by any object oriented language then only we can say that language is object oriented.
//		This are 
//		1. inheritance : --> if their is an hierarchy in the classes or interfaces ( parent-child relation)
//		2. polymorphism : --> poly means multiple, morphs means forms  ( means any method can exist with same name but with different arguments.
//		3. abstraction : --> Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality to the user
//		4. encapsulation : --> encapsulation means encapsulate the data in to one unit.
		
//      Advantages and Disadvantages of OOP
		/*
		 * Code Reusability.
		 * Troubleshooting is easier with the OOP language.
		 * Productivity. 
		 * Data Redundancy. 
		 * Code Flexibility.
		 * Solving problems. 
		 * Security.
